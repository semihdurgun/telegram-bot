<i>2022-06-08 19:39:01</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: Quick teaser for what you'll see on the 3 upcoming base NFT fish:   - 3 breeds (damage/tank/support) - 3 types (organic/infected/mecha) - 4 stats (health/power/defence/speed) - 12 natures (modifies base stats) - 26 passive abilities - 40 moves  Summoning starts FRIDAY ðŸŽ£  https://t.co/lLLGfymmDR
<i>2022-06-08 17:10:00</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @cryptokakarot1 Aye it would be good if we could do that, and maybe something will happen.  But if we do it right now, next weeks people will be upset. Need to wait till EXO launches realistically
<i>2022-06-08 16:54:01</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: If this is good, it will be an amazing reward for everyone who participated in Moonsama carnage.   I'll begin writing up the mechanics of the game and the rough overall plan.   The community has already started piecing things together already:    https://t.co/EZqt4iZ7cd
<i>2022-06-08 16:48:34</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @BrucePon HAHAHAHAHAHAH
<i>2022-06-08 16:47:53</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: Since everything is being shipped so fast in a raw, organic format, a lot of things will need to be changed and even introduced each week.   This really opens up the direction of the game to the players, where community feedback is going to be an important part of the evolution.
<i>2022-06-08 16:47:52</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: I think there's going to be enough build diversity already with those 3 initial base fish.   Breeding itself will have its own entire metagame.   If the demand for competitive fish is there, we're going to see fish barons pop up. Likely people with experience in blockchain games.
<i>2022-06-08 16:47:52</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: Each week there's going to be drama. Everyone's going to be fighting over rank 1 each week and trying to snipe it at the last minute.   Every Sunday before carnage, we will see the leaderboard.   Every week new counters found and the meta shifts.
<i>2022-06-08 16:47:52</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: Will be cute having them swim around our ponds, but I'd imagine everyone will dive into the theory crafting around their team compositions right away.   Planning which 5-fish team they're going to attack the leaderboard with.
<i>2022-06-08 16:47:51</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: First thing I'm looking forward to is sacrificing my resources to an ancient God and minting my NFT fish.   Their base stats, move, passive, breed and nature are all generated randomly.   Some people gonna get lucky with high rolled fish, can't wait to see the flexing
<i>2022-06-08 16:33:39</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: People had played Minecraft for years, even "pros" joined in, steep learning curve.   Pondsama however is brand new, purely strategy based, no one even knows the meta (most effective tactic available).   Going to be interesting to see which big brains dominate this one.
<i>2022-06-08 15:51:48</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @samagotshi @Exterwat Aye when EXO launches there will be a new resource economy   Gganbu shared 50/50 between moonsamas and EXOs
<i>2022-06-08 15:50:52</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @Exterwat No taxation in pondsama   1 fish = 1 fish   Gganbu was only needed in carnage due to free players / ticket gangs ruining stuff.   Cant play pondsama without fishies
<i>2022-06-08 10:56:28</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: New concept art by @justinecruzart   Perhaps the lore behind it is revealed within our upcoming Metaverse, set within an ancient flooded city filled with secrets.  https://t.co/3FcH2yNa5b

<i>2022-06-07 21:15:15</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: We need a UX/UI designer BEAST to join Moonsama/Exosama  Figma proficiency is a requirement.  Working on multiple new products and some exciting metaverse stuff.   Reach out to @nicolaimaa if you think you can handle the c h a o s
<i>2022-06-07 20:32:32</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: You've been haunted. You've been infected.  Now it's time to get mechanised.   @ExosamaNFT mecha passes coming next.  https://t.co/8LedtuBa6f
<i>2022-06-07 18:38:33</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @AlbertMalysh @MoonsamaNFT Awesome tweet, I'm sure the community would love seeing things like this really clearly
<i>2022-06-07 15:27:00</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: Moonsama is looking for a frontend wizard to come build with us.   Need to be able to handle the chaos and deliver.    DM @KyilkhorSama if you think you can handle it
<i>2022-06-07 13:56:26</i> <b>@donniebigbags</b>: @MoonbeamNetwork Damn even the @MoonbeamNetwork team going crazy over $aGRAIN
