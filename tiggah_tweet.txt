<i>2022-06-08 19:36:36</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @Kusamaximalist @Bethebankoneti1 @MountainMercury Yeah mate this one is a bit outdated and doesn't do justice to the project  Deffo needs another one when the time is right
<i>2022-06-08 19:07:10</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: Probably the most interesting development with the adoption of XCM I've seen for a while  Big stuff for Dotsama and especially $MOVR and I guess soon $GLMR as well  When Kraken?
<i>2022-06-08 19:00:19</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @nfTUUR They're currently live with multiple projects most notable is probably their project with Dena (Germany's government)  https://t.co/1XdObOqR51
<i>2022-06-08 18:43:11</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: It's also good to know that for us who like to hold tokens for certain reasons it's good that they're scaling heavily outside of Dotsama unlike many projects on it to attract more market share elsewhere and bring those announcements that we all are waiting for
<i>2022-06-08 18:38:06</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @gowthamaran1 @0xgkhn0 @DonnieBigBags @RiRi_gonewild @jimmy_gonzm @Trobriand15 Welcome mate, seen you active since day 1 :)
<i>2022-06-08 18:32:12</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: The right angle to read this between the lines is that once KILT moves towards other blockchains and ecosystems it means increased chances of getting more projects from other ecosystems onboard with KILT  Think about ADA projects or if they'd go to Cosmos, Cosmos projects

<i>2022-06-08 18:24:01</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: Great post about $KILT's W3N  "However, in ENS this is a domain name URL, which represents an address, not a DID."  "In contrast, web3name is not limited to any chain or ecosystem."  "Ethereum and more blockchains will be added in the coming months"  What's next after $ADA?

<i>2022-06-06 14:07:08</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @DonnieBigBags @Polkadot This is awesome  I've never seen anyone supporting NFTs as much in this space as you, even outside of your own project  Moonsama mentality - bring them all together
<i>2022-06-06 12:54:18</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @Noobster93 @DonnieBigBags @jimmy_gonzm @MoonsamaNFT @ExosamaNFT Welcome, now you know the basics so the hardest part is done

<i>2022-06-06 00:33:58</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: @pMr_NL @DonnieBigBags @MoonsamaNFT @ExosamaNFT "My resources revenue is already improving and has more than doubled since last week." That's a good shill mate  Welcome and don't worry it'll only get better after the first few games

<i>2022-06-06 00:17:05</i> <b>@tiggerscrypto</b>: Moonsama's Carnage hit 975 players tonight which is a 50% jump from one month ago  There were so many players that servers had to be restarted but this time the team fixed it much faster than last time  There's only one team in the world who can make Moonsama's vision a reality
